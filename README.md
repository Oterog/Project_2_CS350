# Side Notes

* You should use markdown (.md) files, similar to README.md,
  for any description of the system assigned to you.

* DO NOT PUT EVERYTHING in README.md; use additional files.
  (We could probably use a .md for each seperate step)

* VS Code has extensions for editing markdown files;
  search for and install them as usual
