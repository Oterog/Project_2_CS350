## Overview of Future Plans

Apache Gora is actively developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation, with a roadmap that includes several enhancements to improve backend support, scalability, usability, and community engagement. These improvements are aimed at broadening the system's capabilities, improving its performance, and making it more accessible to a wider audience.

## Improved Backend Support

- **Expansion of Supported Databases**: There are plans to extend the list of supported NoSQL backends, especially as it's current list is of supported backends is not very long. Future releases may include support for popular databases like Redis, CouchDB, and Elasticsearch.
- **Customizable Storage Layers**: Gora aims to improve its pluggable storage architecture, making it easier for users to integrate with additional backends without needing extensive customization that is currently required.
- **Better Compatibility with SQL-based Stores**: Another possible future enhancement is the development of more sophisticated connectors for SQL-based storage, enabling hybrid storage solutions in applications where both SQL & NoSQL systems are used.

## Enhanced Scalability

- **Improved Data Processing Capabilities**: Apache Gora plans to improve it's integration with different distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark and Hadoop to handle larger datasets - and their traffic - more efficiently.
- **Optimized Data Partitioning**: There are also efforts being made to optimize the partitioning & distribution of data in different Gora-supported databases, improving overall performance and allowing for the handling of bigger, more complex data sets while offering lower latency.

## Better Usability and Documentation

- **Simplified Configuration**: Future releases will are planned to include an even more streamlined process for setting up and configuring Apache Gora. This particularly includes automation of some of the more complex tasks (such as schema creation and datastore integration).
- **Improved User Interface**: Although Gora is primarily a backend tool, there are plans to enhance its interaction with graphical interfaces or higher-level frameworks, making it easier to visualize data models and manage data storage.
- **Better Documentation**: The Gora team wants to great improve it's documentation by providing more in-depth tutorials, real-world use cases, and examples - especially for non-Java users. This would help bridge the gap for developers coming from programming languages other than Java.

## Integration with Modern Technologies

- **Cloud-Native Support**: Cloud-native technologies have become more prevalent all around the world, and consequently Gora wants to improve its compatibility with several different cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) as well as modern storage solutions like Amazon DynamoDB and Google Bigtable.
- **Support for Real-Time Data**: Gora is exploring real-time data processing features, which wiould make it suitable for streaming applications, different Internet of Things devices, and real-time analytics.
- **Microservices Compatibility**: Gora plans to improve the integration with different microservices-based architectures, which would hopefully make Gora a more appealing choice for modern cloud-native applications.

## Community Building and Outreach

- **Growing the Developer Community**: The Apache Gora project is working on initiatives to attract more contributors and build a larger, more active community, especially as it has a relatively small userbase. This would include better support for new contributors and outreach to different organizations using NoSQL databases.
- **More Active User Support**: As the userbase grows, Gora will be putting an increased focus on community-driven support through mailing lists, forums, and issue trackers.
